# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open development platform, we have some rules, chumps. So read carefully.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being the very best, like no one ever was
* Catching them as your real test, and training them as your cause
* Being able to handle having your code reviewed
* Actually contributing sometimes
* Having an open channel for communication
* Actually helping people on StackOverflow
* Reviewing pull requests sincerely
* Writing Junit tests to go along with your code

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Extending your reach to the stars above
* Denouncing the evils of truth and love
* Suggesting that we use MySQL
* Using light-theme IDEs
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Being a dick
* Trying to sell us herbal supplements or diet pills
* Thinking about leaking the token

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
We're not strict, but we're also not idiots.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
If we ever decide to go that far.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at kjx015@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
In other words, you will be forever mocked in the bot's source code. Take THAT!
