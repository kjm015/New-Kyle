Welcome! This project is an open-source [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin)-based Discord bot that uses the [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [Josh Grosh](https://github.com/jagrosh)'s [JDA Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities).

## Introduction
This project is a collaboration between myself and a few of my friends. It is a proof of concept and learning tool for those who wish to learn modern development practices and tools. It was inspired by one of our friends who used to be in our Discord server. The functionality contained within is supposed to emulate his mannerism as closely as possible.

## Current State and Future Plans
As it stands, this bot is simply a testbed and learning platform for myself and my friends to get acquainted with modern development tools and APIs. Eventually, I plan on taking the things that were most valuable in this project and moving on to develop a more serious, useful bot for a wider audience.

For now, it is purely for recreation. More updates will be posted as more functionality of the bot becomes available.
